# Customer-Car-Purchase-Prediction
Here we make Predictions of car purchase by customer using Machine Learning algorithms.

Here we used Social_network_Ads dataset which providing information regarding the person's age and estimated salary & if he/she is interested in buying a car by watching an advertisement on Social Network.(yes=1,No=0). we will predict that what are the chances of new person of some age to be interested in buying car by watching the same Social Media Advertisement.

##Conclusion: Among all implemented algorithms , Support Vector Machine(SVC) and KNN perform well on Social Media dataset.
Accuracy of KNN and SVM : 93%
